# Resolve Denied Tool Call

Proposing a permission is costly — it blocks progress until the user notices and approves it, and they may be away or running other agents. Invest real effort into checking whether the allow list already covers what's needed through a different path.

## Check for Alternatives First

Read `~/.claude/settings.json` (global, symlinked from dotfiles) plus `.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/settings.local.json` in the working directory. Look for permitted commands that accomplish the same thing — especially project scripts and allowed package-manager invocations.

Examples of non-obvious alternatives:

- `Bash(bash scripts/check-gpu.sh *)` is allowed — no need for `ssh lab-server nvidia-smi`. The script already SSHes to the configured server.
- `Bash(bun run db:query *)` is allowed — no need for `psql -c "SELECT..."`. The script runs queries with proper credentials.
- `Bash(uv run scripts/download_model.py *)` is allowed — no need for `curl -L -o models/gpt2.bin https://...`. The script handles authenticated downloads.

## Continue With Other Work

If the denied command only blocks one part of the task, move on to other parts. Batch the permission proposal for when no further progress is possible.

## Proposing a Permission

Only after confirming no permitted alternative exists, read `references/adding-permissions.md` for how to propose a well-scoped rule. Global rules go in the dotfiles `settings.json` and get committed there; project rules go in the project's `.claude/settings.json`.

Lifted from [alignment-hive/plugins/autopilot](https://github.com/Crazytieguy/alignment-hive/tree/main/plugins/autopilot) (deprecated upstream in favour of built-in auto mode); the deno-sandbox references were dropped.
